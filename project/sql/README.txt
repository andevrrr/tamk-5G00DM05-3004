1. Navigate to the Project Directory
------------------------------------
Change into the project directory:
cd project

2. Start the Server

To start the server, run:
npm start

The server itself will create tables and insert data into them. If the tables are not empty, their contents will remain. If you want to clear the tables, open the database.db file and erase all the contents.
